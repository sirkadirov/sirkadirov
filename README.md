## Hi there 👋!
Hi, friends 👋🏻! My name is Yurii Kadirov, and I'm 20 years old software developer and a public figure from the beautiful country of Ukraine. I have always been interested in IT, self-learning technologies, languages, and other essential things every developer should know. Now I'm studying for my bachelor's degree in Computer science and computer-engineered intelligent systems at the Ivan Franko National University of Lviv. Also, I'm a Head of a non-commercial organization called "Supreme Order" - its primary goal is to support and develop youth initiatives in my country. Recently, I joined NGO "Solidarity Youth", the youth wing of the "European Solidarity" party.

- 👨🏻‍💻 Software developer (C#, .NET, ASP.NET, Blazor, Rust, etc)
- 🙏🏻 Head of non-profit organization "[Supreme Order](https://supremeorder.rocks/)"
- 🚀 Active member of non-profit organization "[Solidarity Youth](https://www.facebook.com/SolidarnaMolod/)"
- 📫 You can contact me in [any convenient way](https://sirkadirov.com/contact) available
- ☕ [Buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/sirkadirov) or apply if you find my projects useful
- **❤ More about me and my work on [my official website](https://aka.sirkadirov.com/hello.int)**

I think the FOSS movement is what we need to boost in the next ten years, so I'm releasing most of my pet projects under permissive licenses like MIT or GNU GPL (or even the Unlicense on some projects) and trying to commit to third-party projects from time to time.
