## My latest projects
- [**Overtest**](https://github.com/overtest) — an online judging system for holding programming competitions and long-term educational processes in schools and universities, where students learn programming.
- [**UniSched**](https://github.com/unisched) — a useful web and mobile application for Ukrainian students and teachers to track their schedule and access online services of their educational institutions in a single tap or click.

I think the FOSS movement is what we need to boost in the next ten years, so I'm releasing most of my pet projects under permissive licenses like MIT or GNU GPL (or even the Unlicense on some projects) and trying to commit to third-party projects from time to time.
